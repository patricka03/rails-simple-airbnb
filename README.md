# Rails Simple Airbnb 🏡✨

## Description
Rails Simple Airbnb is a minimalistic Airbnb-style application where users can **add, edit, update, and delete flats**. While the front-end is kept simple, the focus is on building a solid **backend** with functional database operations. Perfect for demonstrating CRUD capabilities in Rails!

## Features
- **Create** a new flat with essential details.
- **Edit & update** existing flats.
- **Delete** flats when no longer needed.
- **Rails ActiveRecord** manages database interactions.
- **Minimal front-end**, prioritizing backend logic.

## Technologies Used
- **Ruby on Rails** – Framework for backend development.
- **PostgreSQL** – Database management.
- **HTML & CSS** – Basic styling for minimal UI.
- **Bootstrap (if used)** – Helps with simple styling.
